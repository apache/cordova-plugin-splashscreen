### Android Quirks

In your `config.xml`, you need to add the following preferences:

    <preference name="SplashScreen" value="foo" />
    <preference name="SplashMaintainAspectRatio" value="true|false" />

Where foo is the name of the splashscreen file, preferably a 9 patch file. Make sure to add your splashcreen files to your res/xml directory under the appropriate folders. See [Icons and Splash Screens](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/config_ref_images.md.html)
for more information.

"SplashMaintainAspectRatio" preference is optional. If set to true, splash screen drawable is not stretched to fit screen, but instead simply "covers" the screen, like CSS "background-size:cover". This is very useful when splash screen images cannot be distorted in any way, for example when they contain scenery or text. This setting works best with images that have large margins (safe areas) that can be safely cropped on screens with different aspect ratios.

The plugin reloads splash drawable whenever orientation changes, so you can specify different drawables for portrait and landscape orientations.

### Browser Quirks

You can use the following preferences in your `config.xml`:

    <platform name="browser">
        <preference name="SplashScreen" value="images/browser/splashscreen.jpg" /> <!-- defaults to "img/logo.png" -->
        <preference name="SplashScreenDelay" value="10000" /> <!-- defaults to "3000" -->
        <preference name="SplashScreenBackgroundColor" value="green" /> <!-- defaults to "#464646" -->
        <preference name="ShowSplashScreen" value="false" /> <!-- defaults to "true" -->
        <preference name="SplashScreenWidth" value="600" /> <!-- defaults to "170" -->
        <preference name="SplashScreenHeight" value="300" /> <!-- defaults to "200" -->
    </platform>


### iOS Quirks

- `FadeSplashScreen` (boolean, defaults to `true`): Set to `false` to
  prevent the splash screen from fading in and out when its display
  state changes.

        <preference name="FadeSplashScreen" value="false"/>

- `FadeSplashScreenDuration` (float, defaults to `2`): Specifies the
  number of seconds for the splash screen fade effect to execute.

        <preference name="FadeSplashScreenDuration" value="4"/>

- `ShowSplashScreenSpinner` (boolean, defaults to `true`): Set to `false`
  to hide the splash-screen spinner.

        <preference name="ShowSplashScreenSpinner" value="false"/>

## splashscreen.hide

Dismiss the splash screen.

    navigator.splashscreen.hide();


### BlackBerry 10, WP8, iOS, Android Quirk

The `config.xml` file's `AutoHideSplashScreen` setting must be
`false`. To delay hiding the splash screen for two seconds, add a
timer such as the following in the `deviceready` event handler:

        setTimeout(function() {
            navigator.splashscreen.hide();
        }, 2000);

## splashscreen.show

Displays the splash screen.

    navigator.splashscreen.show();


Your application cannot call `navigator.splashscreen.show()` until the app has
started and the `deviceready` event has fired. But since typically the splash
screen is meant to be visible before your app has started, that would seem to
defeat the purpose of the splash screen.  Providing some configuration in
`config.xml` will automatically `show` the splash screen immediately after your
app launch and before it has fully started and received the `deviceready`
event. See [Icons and Splash Screens](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/config_ref_images.md.html)
for more information on doing this configuration. For this reason, it is
unlikely you need to call `navigator.splashscreen.show()` to make the splash
screen visible for app startup.
